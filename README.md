Hi, my name is Glenn Winter and thank you for this opportunity to do a technical test.

I have used PHP version 8.3, node v22 and Laravel v11.23.5 with some bootstrap and javascript too.

**Things you'll need to do to get it working on your machine:**

1. Ensure you have PHP, Composer and Node.js installed
2. Clone this repo, the branch is 'master': git clone https://github.com/GlennWinter/WorldBankTechTest.git
3. cd into project
4. Run "composer install"
5. Run "npm install"
6. Run "php artisan migrate" to create the log database.
7. Run "npm run build"
8. The project should now be ready to go to your browser and use the application.
9. You can run the tests by this command "php artisan test"

**Future Development Ideas:**
- Have pagination buttons instead of having to scroll for ages on the 'view all countries' view.
- Add dropdown for amount of countries to return
- Have the background be some javascript library of a world which will rotate to depending on what ISO code was inputted.
- Add a filter list for the country names like A, B, C etc
- Add feature tests
- Add more unit tests for the service layer and other files


Thank you for your time - I hope to hear from you soon.
